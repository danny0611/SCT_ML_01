Implement of linear regression model
# Linear Regression Model

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of a Linear Regression model. Below is an overview of the project and how to use it.

## Contents

- `Linear Regression Model.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook file where the Linear Regression model is implemented.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection.
- **Model Implementation**: Step-by-step construction of a Linear Regression model.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of the data and model results.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics to assess the performance of the model.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or above
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Libraries:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/linear-regression.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd linear-regression
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Linear Regression Model.ipynb"
   ```
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute each cell and observe the results.

## Results

The notebook provides:

- Insights into the dataset.
- Model coefficients and intercept.
- Visualizations of the regression line against the data.
- Evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
